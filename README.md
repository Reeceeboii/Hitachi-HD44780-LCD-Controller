# Hitachi-HD44780-LCD-Controller
## My attempt at writing code to control a TC1602B足01 (HD44780 compatible) LCD module without any LCD specific libraries.

I haven't done any electronics based stuff in a while so figured I needed a fairly interesting project to get back into the flow of things. I have an LCD module (Tinsharp TC1602B足01) sitting in my box of electronics along with an Arduino so figured I'd wire them up and write the control code myself to hopefully renew my knowledge and learn a thing or two along the way.

## The plan
The majority of the control signals that get sent to the screen are done so via the 8 (D0-D7) data pins that are visible on the front of the module. Now sending data to these pins individually sounds (and is) a pain, so luckily we can make use of the Arduino's port registers to allow quicker and more efficient access to these pins via the code. We can send out a byte of data at once as opposed to 8 individual calls to a digital write function doing a bit at a time. This makes for faster and more lightweight code.

First of all, we need to wire it up - here's a schematic I threw together before starting:

(one thing to note is that having pins 0 and 1 in use by our program may cause issues when flashing the board. I had issues with avrdude during this step. Simply disconnecting the jumpers solves this and you can reconnect them straight after.)

And a somewhat accurate recreation:

You can see 8 data bits are wired into PORTD (pins 0 through 7) and the control signals and clock latch pins wired into the lesser 3 bits of PORTB.

GPIO pins aren't needed for power nor ground so those are wired into the regular 5V and GND pins on the far side of the board.
